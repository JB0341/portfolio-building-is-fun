# portfolio-building-is-fun

This was the week 2 challenge.

The goal was to create a portfolio from scratch using all the HTML and CSS learned up to now and any research done.

The steps taken are listed below.

# Start

Started by creating a repository, cloning to machine, and creating needed folders and documents to code in. 

Also added needed images.


# HTML

Built HTML to display a header with a working nav bar. Which was to be linked to portions of the page and navigate there. 

Built HTML to show "About Me" "Work" "Contact Info" and "Resume" accordingly. The first two being in the main body and last two in the footer. 

 
# CSS

Used basic CSS, CSS variables, Flex-Box, and CSS Grid to style the page as close to the example as possible. This was done while maintaining working operation of the page.
